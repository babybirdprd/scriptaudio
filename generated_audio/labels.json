It’s super simple, but I think it always looks put together. Basically, I start with a pair of my favorite straight-leg jeans, the ones I got from Madewell, and then I just throw on this oversized cream-colored sweater. I like this one because it’s super comfy. For shoes, I usually go with my white sneakers. They’re just classic and work with everything. And that’s really it, super simple, right? Let me know in the comments what your favorite casual outfit is and don't forget to subscribe for more style ideas!",
